AST - WS 2018 Project : Object List Merger
Description:
Given a set of observations from two sensors, this object list merger algorithm evaluates the belief of the two sensor readings, and assigns a label to the objects.
The sensors are selected such that one is an absolute sensor, for instance, a 3D RGB-D camera, and the other is a relative sensor, for instance, a 2D RGB camera. Through the usage of these two sensors, the objects can be identified with an increased belief, which can then be used for further processing in user application.
Installation Steps:
In order to test this algorithm yourself (and suggest changes):
    Fork this repository to your local repo, clone it to your machine.
    Download the code and run it terminal window Robot_recogniser.py files
Executing the Code:
The code can be executed through through command line.
For command line execution:
    Browse to the project path.
    Open a new terminal window, and run the following command: python Robot_recogniser.py, command line would show an output of sensor readings.
Testing the Code:
The code can also be tested through terminal.
    Browse to the project path.
    Execute TestCase.py Testing output would assert whether the output is true for a given expected value.

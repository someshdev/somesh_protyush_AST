#### AST - WS 2018 Project : Object List Merger <br />
###### Description:<br />
Given a set of observations from two sensors, this object list merger algorithm evaluates the confidences of the two sensor readings, and assigns a id to the objects.<br />
These sensors are selected such that one is an absolute sensor, for instance, a 3D RGB-D camera, and the other is a relative sensor, for instance, a 2D RGB camera. Through the usage of these two sensors, the objects can be identified with an increased belief, which can then be used for further processing in user application.<br />

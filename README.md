AST - WS 2018 Project : Object List Merger<br />
Description:<br />
Given a set of observations from two sensors, this object list merger algorithm evaluates the belief of the two sensor readings, and assigns a label to the objects.<br />
The sensors are selected such that one is an absolute sensor, for instance, a 3D RGB-D camera, and the other is a relative sensor, for instance, a 2D RGB camera. Through the usage of these two sensors, the objects can be identified with an increased belief, which can then be used for further processing in user application.<br />
Installation Steps:<br />
In order to test this algorithm yourself (and suggest changes):<br />
    Fork this repository to your local repo, clone it to your machine.<br />
    Download the code and run it terminal window Robot_recogniser.py files<br />
Executing the Code:<br />
The code can be executed through through command line.<br />
For command line execution:<br />
    Browse to the project path.<br />
    Open a new terminal window, and run the following command: python Robot_recogniser.py, command line would show an output of sensor readings.<br />
Testing the Code:<br />
The code can also be tested through terminal.<br />
    Browse to the project path.<br />
    Execute TestCase.py Testing output would assert whether the output is true for a given expected value.<br />
Summary:<br />
Source coded in Python 2.7.13.<br />
Source code files:<br />
  Robot_recognizer.py<br />
  TestCase.py<br />
